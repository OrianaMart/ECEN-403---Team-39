The Machine Learning (ML) model serves as the core of the equipment scanning functionality, enabling users to capture an image of an unknown piece of equipment and obtain its category. Developed using a Functional Keras API, the model has flexibility to accommodate the complexities of the training data. The training dataset, containing a large collection of images, is stored on a Google Drive accessible by the Google Colab notebook housing the model. This method minimizes the risk of file corruption during unzipping and allows for the retention of a larger image dataset for training purposes.
The model undergoes training on 14 of the most commonly used categories of lab equipment, making it an effective tool for equipment scanning. Post-training, the model is converted into a tflite file, compatible with the flutter_tflite package, permitting backend integration into the application without requiring cloud hosting. This integration within the application ensures a streamlined scanning for users.
This scanning process can take place at any stage of the equipment check-out/check-in process, although it proves most advantageous during the check-in portion for administrators. The scan results provide the appropriate equipment location based on the assigned category, thus mitigating the likelihood of inventorying errors.
