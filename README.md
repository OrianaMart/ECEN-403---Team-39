The  student UI part is where the student can have access to the app like checking out or in equipment or making reservations before coming into the lab. This will interact with mostly the user database because that's where the student can make reservations and fill out forms. 


The  administrative UI part is where the staff can have access to the app like using the forms, view checked outs, approve student checks you and in, account change notification and revising data. This part of the UI will mostly interact with the user database because the user database will include all the actions that the TA and other people account are allowed to use in the app.
