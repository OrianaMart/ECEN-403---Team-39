The Machine Learning (ML) model is responsible for taking an image of the lab equipment and adding a label/category to it. Using a database that link with the inventory it will be able to give the user the most updated information on the categorization of the equipment. To train the model a dataset will be created as well as a training set that will be used to check the accuracy of the model.


There will be two dataset used for ML model. One dataset will be used to train the model so that it knows how and what to label images. This dataset will most likely be acquired by taking multiple images fo lab equipment and compiling it into something that the model can use. The second dataset will be used to validate the functionality of the model by acting as a testbench. With these images it is possible to check the accuracy of the model and make adjustments to its complexity.
