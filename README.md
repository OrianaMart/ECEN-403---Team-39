# ECEN-404---Team-39
  With the increase in usage of computer intelligence worldwide, a vast amount of secondary tasks are becoming more efficient to perform. Currently, the equipment used by ECEN Capstone projects is stored in Wisenbaker room 156 and is managed manually on paper. This process becomes more inefficient for TAs during the peak periods of semester initiation and conclusion when checkouts and check-ins occur most frequently.
The Smart Inventory application creates a streamlined tracking system for both students and application administrators. This will enable students to make checkout requests and track the availability of equipment via the application. Additionally, this will also enable administrators to access information regarding the current status of checked-out-equipment, the storage location of equipment, and allow seamless communication with students as necessary.
  The Smart Inventory application aims to create an efficient inventory tracking system, enabling administrators to track equipment stored within the ECEN Capstone lab. The application enables students to access a secure account, facilitating the reservation of equipment for use in their Capstone project. TAs have the ability to review and approve equipment requests, along with the capacity to grant additional permissions required for specialized equipment. In instances where there is an unknown piece of equipment, the application incorporates a machine learning (ML) model. Users can utilize this model to scan equipment, receiving the category results that enhance the ease of storing available equipment within the lab.
